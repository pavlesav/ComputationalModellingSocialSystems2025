# Computational Modelling of Social Systems
[Fariba Karimi](https://networkinequality.com/), 2025

Welcome to the online materials for Computational Modelling of Social Systems. In this course, you will learn how to formulate and analyze computational models of social systems, in particular to study social interaction and the behavior of large groups of people and whole societiess. The course integrates content about social dynamics and analytic tools to understand the complex behavior of social systems. After this course, you will acquire programming skills to implement, simulate, and visualize these models.

## Who am I?

Fariba Karimi is the Professor for Computational Behavioral and Social Sciences the Graz University of Technology. Fariba Karimi leads the Complexity Science Hub’s computational social science team. Fariba received a PhD in physics and computational science from Umea University, in Sweden, in 2015 and was a PostDoc at GESIS – Leibniz Institute for Social Sciences, in Germany. Fariba’s research focuses on computational social science, the emergence of biases and inequality in networks and algorithms, and modelling human behavior. Her recent research revolves around the topics of visibility of minorities in social networks, the impact of network structure on ranking and recommender algorithms, and disparities in academia and its impact on under-represented groups. She combines statistical analyses of large datasets of online interactions with computational models, agent-based modeling, and network analysis. In 2022, Fariba together with a team of international researchers was awarded an EU Horizon grant to study multi-criteria fairness in AI systems. In 2023, she received the Young Scientist Award from the German Physical Society for her research on inequality in complex networks. Since January 2023, Fariba has also been an assistant professor at TU Wien. I teach this course in collaboration with student tutor Pavle Savković as well as Jaramillo Mejia, Ana Maria. Several people have contributed to the materials of this course over time, especially [Dr. Petar Jerčić](http://www.petarjercic.com/), [Dr. Jana Lasser](https://janalasser.at/) and [Dr. Max Pellert](https://mpellert.at/).

### Final Project:

13. **Poster presentation** (25.06.2025)
- Four hours session with food and drinks provided in the break after two hours

14. The deadline to submit your **final report** (09.07.2025). You can submit over Teach Center. [projects guide]()

## Where to access materials

- Students at TU Graz can access the [course at Teach Center](https://tc.tugraz.at/main/course/view.php?id=4384) to get additional information, watch videos from previous years on Tube, and to participate in the forums.
- Most of the communication will happen on [discord](https://discord.gg/9rYVEvzqNe), here you can ask questions where we will respond in the shortest time period.

## Place and time

The course takes place on Wednesdays at 15:00 (sharp) and lasts 2 hours. The lecture part of the course will take place in room [HS A (Kopernicusgasse 24)](https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/ee/ui/ca2/app/desktop/#/pl/ui/$ctx/ris.einzelRaum?raumKey=4010) and exercise part will take place in room [HS E (Kopernicusgasse 24)](https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/ee/ui/ca2/app/desktop/#/pl/ui/$ctx/ris.einzelRaum?raumKey=3998)

## Graded exercizes information


We have restructured the format compared to previous years format compared to the previous years. Exercises had become somewhat outdated and were widely circulated among students from previous years, making it easier for new students to find solutions and complete the tasks with minimal effort.

This year, graded assignments will involve reproducing specific figures from provided research papers. There are 10 papers in total for you to choose from, and you must select one for each of the two assignments.

Your submissions should be in .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) format and should follow the structure of previous years’ notebooks, which you can find in the GitHub repository under the folder "Last_year_exercises." Your notebooks should include markdown cells with textual explanations of your approach, followed by code cells implementing the necessary steps. 

Each of the four exercises in this folder has two versions:
  - A version without a solution, where curious students can write the code yourself (similar to the Foundations of Computational Social Systems course).
  - A complete solution, which you can run to see the results.
    
You are recommended to go through these notebooks to familiarize yourself with Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). This will provide valuable context and enhance your understanding of the techniques used. This is a great opportunity to deepen your understanding of Agent-Based Modeling, and I’m sure you will enjoy the process.

Many of the assigned papers have online resources available, such as tutorials and code explanations on platforms like YouTube or existing GitHub repositories. You are encouraged to use these as learning tools, but you must properly cite any external resources by linking them in your notebook. Simply copying and pasting code from an online source is not acceptable—you should retype, adapt, and engage with the code as a learning experience. Your code should be compatible with the most recent Mesa update, that will be one way for us to check if you\ve done the work or just copied old, outdated code (anything older than a year is not compatible). 

Additionally, you must contribute something new and unique beyond simply reproducing the figure. This could be:

  - Modify the original model and discuss the changes
  - Test the model with new parameters and observe changes
  - A new visualization
  - An alternative perspective on the subject
  - Additional graphs or plots that provide further insight
