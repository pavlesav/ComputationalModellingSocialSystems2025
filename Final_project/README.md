# Computational Modelling of Social Systems: Projects Guide

50% of the course assessment is based on a final course project. Projects are done in groups that can have at most 4 students and must mix students with different backgrounds (at least two different backgrounds per group). The purpose of the project is to show what you have learned in the course in terms of modelling social systems. Projects have to start from a research question and have an empirical or theoretical focus, while critically reflecting on methods, hypotheses, conclusions, and limitations.


## Some basic information:

**Option 1:**
- Propose a **new project** with a topic related to computational modelling with an application that has not been part of the assignments. For example, combining two different models seen during the class, such as the group formation and the spreading model, where different rules are considered for the interaction of individuals (attributes of the individuals, homophily, size of the groups, number of simulations) and the spreading process (the probabilities/rules of getting in different contagious stages, time length of the contagion, multiple or single spreadings). 
  
- Formulate a research question based on a small literature review on the chosen models (4-6 papers) and identify some literature gaps (for example, future work that has not been developed/published elsewhere or some theoretical models that can be applied to other contexts).
  
- Implement a model with empirical data or simulations to solve/explore the research question.

**Option 2:**
- **Extension of the previous assignments** while following the scientific method practices for the final project. 

- Formulate a research question based on a small literature review (4-6 papers) and identify some literature gap (search for more recent work on the same topic and situate the gap that your project wants to fill, for example, future work that has not been developed/published elsewhere or applying the model to solve questions or understand other contexts).  

- Based on the literature review, you should improve the model you previously developed during the assignment and make the necessary variations to make your project novel.

For both options, your group should:

- Write a final report following the scientific paper structure: Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Limitations, and Conclusions. Submit the final report by **July 9th**.


## Technical details:

- You can get guidance for your projects in one session: **28.05.2025** from **15:00 to 18:00**. There are no lectures from 11.06.2025. 

- Submits a max. 10-page research report. The deadline to submit your report is **July 9th** (end of day). You can submit over Teach Center and a jupyter notebook with the code used during the project.

- Reports must be in PDF, following the scientific paper format: Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Limitations, and Conclusions. **Do not submit Python code or notebooks.**

Below is the timeline of the project deadlines. The deadlines are up to the end of the day marked by each date.

- **28.05.2025:** Project guidance with Ana.
- **09.07.2025:** Submission of the final written report.

The steps to do the course project are the following:

#### 1. Form a group and choose a topic
Get in touch with fellow students over the course discord server or around lectures to form a group. Choose one of the above options and if you want a new topic you can get inspiration from the course and lecture materials. 

#### 2. Project groups registration
In June (02.06), your group has to register for the project on TC group assignment.

#### 3. Submit the final report

Please send the final report as a PDF document (max. 10 pages, min. font size 11pt) via TC.
References do not count towards this 10-page limit. Projects can contain a link to a GitHub repository, including the code to produce results, datasets if they can be shared, and additional figures or tables that can be referenced from the project report.

Project reports should follow this structure:

1. Introduction: Literature review and gap, research question, and how you plan to address the research question.
2. Methodology: This includes a description of the selected model, parameter values, and, if applicable, data acquisition methods and statistical characteristics. 
5. Results: Perform statistical analyses and visualizations that assess the question(s) and analyze the results.
6. Discussion: Discussion of your results with the previous literature.
7. Limitations: State limitations of your proyect and future work to asses them.
8. Conclusion: Wrap up of the main results and the answer to your research question.

Plots should be correctly shown (named axes, visible scales), and writing has to be understandable.


## Project grading

The grade for the project is composed of 100% for the final report. Extra points are given when projects are based on open science principles (e.g. data and codes are available in a Github repository) and when data sources or methods go beyond what is covered in the course. **Projects do not need to report "positive results",** what is important is that you show how you have addressed your research questions, document any issues or deviations, and critically reflect on methods and results.


## Frequently asked questions
- **Do I have to work in a group?**
Yes, individual projects are not allowed. You can use collaborative tools like Github and videoconference technologies to coordinate your project. You can divide tasks as long as you all contribute to the project. Some exceptions about the group composition can be considered for groups composed only of doctoral researchers at TU Graz, contact us if that is your case.
- **Do we need to start with a question?**
Yes, and this question has to be relevant to human behavior. Remember that this course is not data-driven, so please do not start with a cool dataset and then see what to do with it. In general, good research questions can be answered with a yes/no answer or with a number. For example: "Are emotional tweets retweeted more often?" or "is there a correlation between Twitter misspelling frequency and unemployment?". Questions that start with "how" or "what" are usually not good, like "how do people use TikTok?" or "what is Austria's favorite Pokemon?".
- **What if some dataset or model turns out to work differently than we planned?**
This can always happen, and there is no problem with changing some plans about the data retrieval or analysis, as long as you document these well in your report and argue about the changes. What you cannot change is the question and motivation of your project, or make arbitrary, unjustified changes to the plan.
- **What if we don't get "nice" results or don't fit our expectations?**
As long as you followed your plan, the particular results that you get will not factor into the grade. If you get a negative result or a surprising answer, comment on that in the conclusion section and reflect on it in your critique section. Follow our recommendations and feedback during the course, and comment on them in your report if, for some reason, you couldn't follow them.
- **Do we have to use data in the project?**
Not necessarily, this project can be simulation or data-based. Critical discussions are welcome in the last part of the project and theoretical motivations in the first, but ensure that your project has an empirical and quantitative core.
- **Can we use a statistical method or model not covered by the course?**
Yes, but make sure that you understand it well. Don't use a method just because someone told you to do so (for example, on Stack Exchange) or because everyone in your field is using it; think critically and make sure that you don't just run some software and get a magical p-value or something like that. You should also briefly explain this method in your report, cite relevant references, and explain why you used it.
- **How can we share our code and data with you?**
You can share code and data by setting up a GitHub repository and including a link in your report. You will get extra points if the repository is well documented, and it might help other people in their analyses! 
- **Can I use a proprietary dataset I cannot share?**
That's OK if it answers your question well, but you won't qualify for extra points for open science practices. I often run the code of projects myself, and I cannot do that if you can't share the dataset.
- **Do I have to use social media data or other Internet-related data?**
No, but your data has to be relevant to a question about Computational Modelling of Social Systems.
